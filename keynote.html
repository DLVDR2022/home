                        <b>Abstract:</b>
                        Traditional classification and machine learning assumed that the input patter belongs to a set of pre-defined classes. This does not hold in open world, where the input many be novel (out of know classes), and the class set may change. The related problems like open set recognition, class incremental learning, few-shot and zero-shot learning, have been studied using deep learning methods. We proposed a deep network called convolutional prototype network (CPN) for performing these tasks. The CPN is shown to learn a feature space making samples between-class separable and within-class compact, so that novel patterns can be rejected according to nearest distance. By learning new-class prototypes while memorizing old-class prototypes, the CPN can yield superior performance in class-incremental learning, few-shot and zero-shot learning.

                        <div>
                            <b>Abstract:</b>
                            As a fundamental problem in computer vision, semantic segmentation, i.e. the task of automatically assigning a class label to each pixel of an image, has been an active research area for several decades. In the recent years, we have witnessed substantial progress in this area, mostly thanks to the introduction of fully convolutional networks and to the integration of several other architectural components, such as attention models or multi-scale fusion strategies. Despite the astonishing performance, state of the art deep architectures for semantic segmentation still lack one fundamental capability: they cannot update their learned model continuously as new data are made available without losing previously learned knowledge. This is a matter of utmost importance in several applications, such as autonomous driving or robot navigation. The problem, also known as catastrophic forgetting, has been long studied in the research community and several approaches, commonly referred as Incremental Learning (IL) methods have been developed over the years. In computer vision, most research efforts in the area of IL have addressed problems such as image classification and object detection. However, so far, much less attention has been devoted to incremental semantic segmentation. In this talk I would describe our recent works based on knowledge distillation to address the challenging problem of IL for semantic segmentation.
