            <p> Visual analysis especially detection and recognition
                is one of the most important branches of pattern 
                recognition, which focuses on localizing and classifying
                visual patterns involved in various data. In the past years, 
                great progress has been achieved in both the theories and
                applications of visual analysis. A typical visual analysis
                system is composed of pre-processing, feature extraction,
                classifier design and post-processing. Nowadays, we have
                entered a new era of big visual data, which offers both
                opportunities and challenges to the field of visual analysis.
                We should seek new visual detection and recognition theories
                to be adaptive to big visual data. We should also push
                forward new visual applications benefited from big visual data.</p>
            <p> Deep Learning, which can be treated as the most significant
                breakthrough in the past 10 years in the field of pattern
                recognition and machine learning, has greatly affected
                the computer vision methodology and achieved terrific
                progress in both academy and industry. It can be seen
                as a solution to change the whole visual system. It
                achieved an end-to-end visual analysis, merging previous
                steps of pre-processing, feature extraction, classifier
                design and post-processing. It is expected that the
                development of deep learning theories and applications
                would further influence the field of computer vision. </p>
            <p> Since 2016, the international workshop on deep learning
                for pattern recognition has been held three times (DLPR 2016,
                DLPR 2018, DLPR 2020). It successfully brought together
                worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and
                industry to present their innovative research and to discuss
                recent advancements. In this year, we aim to continuously
                organize this workshop in conjunction with the International
                Conference on Pattern Recognition to further emphasize the
                deep learning for visual analysis especially detection and
                recognition. We hope to solicit original contributions, of
                leading researchers and practitioners from academia as well
                as industry, which address a wide range of theoretical and
                application issues in deep learning for visual detection and analysis. </p>
